\begin{question1}
	I know there are degrees of entanglement and different metrics to quantify entanglement but how do you actually compute entanglement? 
\end{question1}


\begin{question3}
	Are there performance metrics that can be used to fairly benchmark quantum and classical systems in terms of computational efficiency and information processing?
\end{question3}
