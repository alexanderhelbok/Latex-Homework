  abstract = {The intensity variations in radio source 3C 273B have been measured at wavelengths of 31.3, 21.2, and 10.6 centimeters. At 31.3 centimeters the variation is quite small, indicating that the variable component of the source is optically thick at this wavelength. Study of several different model sources shows that the observed dependence of the intensity variations on frequency can best be explained by an increase of the electron density in a source region about 2 parsecs in diameter. This interpretation is consistent with the distance to 3C 273 determined from Hubble's law and the observed red shift.},

 abstract = {Recent Goldstone-Haystack radio interferometric observations of the quasars 3C 279 and 3C 273 reveal rapid variations in their fine structure. Most notably, the data for 3C 279, interpreted in terms of a symmetric double-source model and the accepted red-shift distance, indicate differential proper motion corresponding to an apparent speed about ten times that of light. A number of possible mechanisms that might give rise to such an apparent speed are considered; although several may be plausible, no definitive choice can be made on the basis of present evidence. More interferometric observations of quasars are clearly needed to clarify their structure and internal kinematics.},
